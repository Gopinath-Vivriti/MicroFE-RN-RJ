# Micro Frontends with React Native and React JS Web Applications

Implementing Micro Frontends using RePack, WebPack, React Native Web, and WebPack Module Federation.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build modular and scalable frontend architectures for both React Native and React JS Web applications. By leveraging modern tools and frameworks, teams can develop and deploy independent parts of an application seamlessly.

## Technologies Used

- **RePack** and **Webpack**: Bundling and optimizing code for efficient performance across platforms.
- **React Native Web**: Rendering React Native components as web components for enhanced code reusability.
- **Webpack Module Federation**: Integrating independently developed micro frontends into a cohesive application.

## Benefits

- Enables teams to work on different parts of the application independently.
- Promotes agility and collaboration within development teams.
- Delivers robust, scalable, and maintainable software solutions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `yarn`.
3. Start the development server for React Native or React JS Web using respective commands.
